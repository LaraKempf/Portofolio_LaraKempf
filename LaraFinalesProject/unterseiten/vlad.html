    <h1> The actual history of Dracula</h1>
    <p class="firsttext">Vlad the Impaler, commonly known as Dracula, was a historical figure who lived in the 15th century and ruled
        over
        Wallachia, a region in what is now Romania. His life was marked by brutality and a penchant for impaling his
        enemies, earning him the moniker "Vlad the Impaler."</p>

    <h2>Here's a brief overview of his history:</h2>
    <main>

        <div>
            <p> <u>Early Life:</u> Vlad III was born in 1431 in the Transylvanian town of Sighișoara. He was a member of
                the
                House of
                Drăculești, part of the Wallachian ruling elite.

                First Reign: Vlad the Impaler first came to power as the voivode (prince) of Wallachia in 1448, ruling
                for a
                brief period. He was known for his strict and often cruel policies.<br>

                <u> Second Reign:</u> Vlad's second and more notorious reign began in 1456 and lasted until 1462. During
                this
                time, he
                implemented draconian laws and maintained strict order in Wallachia.
            </p>

            <p><u>Impalement:</u> Vlad was infamous for his method of execution, impalement. He would impale his enemies
                and
                criminals
                on long, sharp stakes, leaving them to die in a gruesome and agonizing manner. This gruesome practice
                was
                intended to deter potential threats and maintain control.<br>

                <u>Battles with the Ottoman Empire:</u> Vlad the Impaler fought against the expansion of the Ottoman
                Empire
                into
                Wallachia. He is best known for his battles against the Ottomans, which were marked by extreme cruelty
                and
                vicious tactics. His resistance to the Ottoman Empire has contributed to his legacy as a national hero
                in some
                parts of Romania.

            <u> Capture and Imprisonment</u>: In 1462, Vlad was captured by the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus and
            imprisoned for
            several years. During his imprisonment, his brother Radu took the Wallachian throne with Ottoman
            support.
            <p><u>Death</u>: The exact circumstances of Vlad the Impaler's death are unclear. Some sources suggest that
                he was
                killed
                in battle, while others claim he was assassinated.<br>

                <u>Legacy:</u> Vlad the Impaler's life and reign have left a lasting impact on history and popular culture.
                Bram
                Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula" drew inspiration from Vlad's reputation and the idea of a vampire. Vlad's
                complex
                legacy in Romania is a subject of historical debate, with some viewing him as a patriot who defended
                Wallachia
                from Ottoman influence and others as a cruel tyrant.</p>

            <p>Vlad the Impaler remains a historical figure who continues to capture the imagination as both a brutal
                ruler and
                the inspiration for one of the most enduring literary figures in the horror genre, Count Dracula.</p>
