    <p class="texttop">Bran Castle, often referred to as "Dracula's Castle," is a historic fortress located in Bran,
        Romania. While it is often associated with the fictional character Count Dracula from Bram Stoker's novel, the
        castle's connection to Vlad the Impaler (the real-life figure who partly inspired Dracula) is tenuous. Here's a
        short history of Bran Castle:</p>
    <main>

        <div>
            <p><u>Construction:</u> Bran Castle was built in the 14th century, around 1377, to serve as a fortress on
                the border between the regions of Transylvania and Wallachia. Its primary purpose was to defend against
                invading forces and control the mountain pass.<br>

                <u>The Tepes Connection:</u> While Bran Castle is often associated with Vlad the Impaler, there is
                limited historical evidence to support his direct involvement with the castle. Vlad the Impaler did pass
                through the region during his rule, and he is known for his connections to other fortresses in the
                area.<br>

                <u>Historical Uses:</u> Over the centuries, Bran Castle served various purposes, including as a military
                fortress and a customs checkpoint. It was also used as a royal residence during different periods in its
                history.

        <div>
            <p><u>The Dracula Connection:</u> Bran Castle gained its association with Count Dracula due to its location
                in the Carpathian Mountains, its medieval appearance, and its connections to the history of
                Transylvania. Though it doesn't closely resemble Stoker's fictional castle, it became a popular tourist
                attraction linked to the Dracula legend.<br>

                <u> Modern Museum:</u> Today, Bran Castle is a museum open to the public. It showcases art and furniture
                collections and offers insight into the historical and cultural aspects of the region. Exhibits
                highlight both the factual history of the castle and the fictional elements of the Dracula story.<br>

                Bran Castle is a significant tourist destination, attracting visitors interested in the connection to
                the Dracula legend and those intrigued by its historical and architectural significance. While its
                historical link to Vlad the Impaler is not strong, the castle remains a symbol of Transylvania and the
                enduring fascination with the Dracula myth.
